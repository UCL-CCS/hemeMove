How to use proper velocity inlets for your (non-cylindrical) geometry:

Step 1:
Execute the script to generate the weights file itself
python <base_dir>/hemelb-dev/hemelb/Tools/setuptool/InletProcessing/CreateWeightsFile.py <name of the profile file in your configuration directory>

Please note that the script will also look for your XML and GMY files, so those should reside in the locations indicated in the profile file.
