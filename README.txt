0. Overview ============================================================

HemeLB's documentation is in "doc/HemeLB_doc.pdf". It comprises the
paper submitted to Comput. Phys. Comm. (with the same title and authors)
and the usage at the end of the file. The code is in directory
hemelb/Code, two input configurations and parameters are in the
directory hemelb/Input" (see the documentation for details).

Please email the GENIUS discussion mailing list,
genius-discuss@ucl.ac.uk if you have any problems, or wish to report
bugs, etc.



1. Compiling HemeLB ====================================================

HemeLB can be compiled and run in standalone mode or RealityGrid
steering mode. The definition RG is used to seperate out the RealityGrid
specific parts of HemeLB. A basic makefile is provided in hemelb/Code.
For normal testing purposes, please comment out the DEFS=-DRG line.


2. Running HemeLB ======================================================

HemeLB is run with a single argument that gives the path name to a 
directory which contains the input files. There are currently three sets
of input/output files which can be found in hemelb/Input.

The 3 datasets can be run using (within hemelb/Code)

make test1     (small dataset)
make test2     (large neurovascular dataset)
make test3     (large bifurcation dataset)


3. RealityGrid Steering and Visualisation =============================


4. Ray Tracing outline ================================================

The flow field is rendered by a parallelised raytracer which is built
into the same code as the LB-fluid solver. In other words, the
rendering of the HemeLB is not done externally, which is usually the
case, but within the same application, exploiting the domain
decomposition of the LB solver. The code to perform the ray tracing can
be found in Code/rt.cc. Technical details on the ray tracing core and
the parallel approach implemented are provided elsewhere.

The parameters used by the ray-tracing algorithm are read from a file
whose name (the path should be specified if not defined in a RSL
script) must occupy the 4-th line of the input file which is read on
command line as first argument when submitting a job (see
hemelb/Doc/HemeLB_doc.pdf). The rendering parameters must be inserted
in different lines and are

pixels_x
pixels_y
ctr_x
ctr_y
ctr_z
longitude
latitude
zoom
image_frequency
flow_field_type
is_isosurface
absorption_factor
cutoff
density_max
velocity_max
stress_max

"pixels_x" and "pixels_y" are the pixels along the X axis and Y one
respectively; "ctr_x", "ctr_y", "ctr_z" specify the center of the
scene. The viewpoint looks towards that point from the viewpoint
angles "longitude" and "latitude" which define the polar and vertical
angles respectively. "zoom" changes the projection size of the
rendering.  The latter is performed at every "image_frequency" LB time
steps. "flow_field_type" must be 0, 1, or 2 if the pressure/density,
velocity or effective von Mises stress flow fields respectively must
be rendered. The iso-surface is calculated if "is_isosurface" is 1,
otherwise the volume rendering with "absorption_factor" as opacity
factor is performed. The parameter "cutoff" must be between 0 and 1;
if the velocity field is on, the volume rendering (or the iso-surface)
is calculated considering only the fluid lattice sites which have a
velocity greater than or equal to cutoff * velocity_max. A similar
argument holds for the density/pressure and effective stress rendering
modes.

The image is outputted on file which must be specified in the 5-th line
of the input file which is read on command line as first argument when
submitting a job. Its format is under investigation and will be
descripted elsewhere.
