     JH Note: Class created to make the new decomposition communication strategy in #142 testable.
     Will not initially contain all decomposition-related code, will gradually add this.
     Eventually, will do the decomposition, and have clean interfaces to provide each site's owned and needed blocks during geometry reading.
     Site ownership during simulation will not be managed by this class, but by the lattice data as currently.
