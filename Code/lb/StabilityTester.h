     * because we can assess the stability just before communicating (it doesn't have to happen
     * at the same time on all nodes), only one communication is needed between depths, which
     * can't overlap. We go down the tree to pass the overall stability to all nodes, and we go up
     * the tree to compose the local stability for all nodes to discover whether the simulation as
     * a whole is stable.
